	- 1 glow texture (res: 128)
	- 1 flame texture with 49 sequences (7x7) (res: 2048)
	- 1 smoke texture with 49 sequences (7x7) (res: 2048)

	You can use these textures to create a next-gen flame thrower/fire/explosion in your game engine, be it Unity, UDK, UE4, CryEngine, Havok etc.


	NOTE:
	ResetExplosion.cs script activates explosion particles once every 2 seconds. It does nothing else.
